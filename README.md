# Python Jour 5 - Les Listes

A comprehensive Python beginner course covering fundamental list operations and data manipulation techniques.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project contains 12 progressive exercises designed to teach Python developers how to work with lists effectively. Each job builds upon the previous knowledge, starting from basic list creation and advancing to more complex list manipulation tasks.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand list creation and basic operations
- Master list indexing and slicing
- Learn list modification methods (append, insert, reverse)
- Implement loops and conditionals with lists
- Practice filtering, counting, and aggregation techniques
- Develop problem-solving skills with data structures

## 📋 Project Structure

```
job1   - List creation and display
job2   - List indexing
job3   - Appending elements
job4   - Inserting elements at specific positions
job5   - Element access and modification
job6   - List reversal
job7   - Counting elements with conditions
job8   - Summing even elements
job9   - Finding min/max values
job10  - Conditional sum within range
job11  - Incrementing all elements
job12  - Removing duplicate values
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python_Jour_5-Les_Listes.git
cd Python_Jour_5-Les_Listes
```

2. Run any exercise:
```bash
python "Projet jour 5.py"
```

## 💡 Key Concepts Covered

| Job | Concept | Method |
|-----|---------|--------|
| 1-3 | Basic operations | `print()`, `append()` |
| 4-6 | Modifications | `insert()`, `reverse()` |
| 7-8 | Conditionals & aggregation | `for` loops, `if` statements |
| 9-10 | Built-in functions | `max()`, `min()`, range filtering |
| 11-12 | Advanced iteration | Element updates, duplicate removal |

## 📝 Usage Example

```python
# Job 1: Basic list creation
fruits = ["pomme", "cerise", "orange"]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['pomme', 'cerise', 'orange']

# Job 7: Count elements divisible by 3
L = [8, 24, 48, 2, 16]
count = sum(1 for x in L if x % 3 == 0)
print(count)
```

## ✅ Best Practices Implemented

- Clear job separation with comments
- PEP 8 compliant code formatting
- Descriptive variable names (where applicable)
- No shadowing of Python built-ins
- Proper list operations and methods

## 🔧 Code Quality

All exercises follow Python best practices:
- **Readability**: Clear structure and organization
- **Correctness**: All jobs verified for accurate output
- **Performance**: Efficient list operations
- **Maintainability**: Easy to extend and modify

## 📚 Further Learning

After completing these exercises, explore:
- List comprehensions
- Nested lists and multi-dimensional operations
- List slicing and advanced indexing
- Lambda functions with `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`
- Working with dictionaries and sets
